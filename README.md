I just wanted to get photos back of my partner that died 14 years ago and it's been years of abuse I can get them back it would be amazing there all I had left 

NB. I don't want people to think I'm not willing to co-op because I am no programmer however I do know what's right and what's wrong so give me 48 hours and just to breath in mean time you can message and tell me a bit about what project is just I can u derstand also I'm no fool I need guidance and I'm more than willing to listen and hopefully we can all can help each other ... after what I have been trough I will let anyone go through it's been a nightmare so that's all I got to say for tonight I'm off to sleep 

hope there's a way to message on here I'll check in afternoon gmt 14.00
